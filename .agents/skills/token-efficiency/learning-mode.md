# Token Efficiency - Learning Mode Strategies

This file contains detailed strategies for learning mode: strategic file selection, targeted pattern learning, and broad repository exploration. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for core rules.

## Strategic File Selection for Learning Mode

When entering learning mode, **first determine if this is broad exploration or targeted learning**, then apply the appropriate strategy.

### Learning Mode Types

**Type 1: Broad Exploration** - "Help me understand this codebase", "How is this organized?"
-> Use repository-based strategies below (identify type, read key files)

**Type 2: Targeted Pattern Learning** - "How do I implement X?", "Show me examples of Y"
-> Use targeted concept search (see Targeted Pattern Learning section below)

---

## General Exploration vs Targeted Learning

**When user says -> Use this approach:**

| User Request                       | Approach                | Strategy                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "Help me understand this codebase" | **General Exploration** | Identify repo type -> Read key files             |
| "How is this project organized?"   | **General Exploration** | Read docs -> Entry points -> Architecture        |
| "Show me how to implement X"       | **Targeted Learning**   | Search for X -> Read examples -> Extract pattern |
| "How does feature Y work?"         | **Targeted Learning**   | Grep for Y -> Find best examples -> Explain      |
| "What patterns are used here?"     | **General Exploration** | Read core files -> Identify patterns             |
| "How do I use API method Z?"       | **Targeted Learning**   | Search for Z usage -> Show examples              |

---

## Targeted Pattern Learning

When user asks about a **specific technique or pattern**, use this focused approach instead of broad exploration.

### Examples of Targeted Learning Queries

- "How do variable number of outputs work in Galaxy wrappers?"
- "Show me how to fetch invocation data from Galaxy API"
- "How do I implement conditional parameters in Galaxy tools?"
- "How does error handling work in this codebase?"
- "Show me examples of async function patterns"
- "How are tests structured for workflow X?"

### Targeted Learning Workflow

**STEP 1: Identify the Specific Concept**

Extract the key concept from user's question:

```
User: "How do variable number of outputs work in Galaxy wrappers?"
-> Concept: "variable number of outputs" OR "dynamic outputs"
-> Context: "Galaxy tool wrappers"
-> File types: ".xml" (Galaxy tool wrappers)
```

```
User: "How to fetch invocation data from Galaxy API?"
-> Concept: "fetch invocation" OR "invocation data" OR "get invocation"
-> Context: "Galaxy API calls"
-> File types: ".py" with Galaxy API usage
```

**STEP 2: Search for Examples**

Use targeted searches to find relevant code:

```bash
# For Galaxy variable outputs example
grep -r "discover_datasets\|collection_type.*list" --include="*.xml" | head -20
grep -r "<outputs>" --include="*.xml" -A 10 | grep -i "collection\|discover"

# For Galaxy invocation fetching
grep -r "invocation" --include="*.py" -B 2 -A 5 | head -50
grep -r "show_invocation\|get_invocation" --include="*.py" -l

# For conditional parameters
grep -r "<conditional" --include="*.xml" -l | head -10

# For error handling patterns
grep -r "try:\|except\|raise" --include="*.py" -l | xargs grep -l "class.*Error"
```

**STEP 3: Rank and Select Examples**

**Selection criteria (in priority order):**

1. **Documentation/Comments** - Files with good comments explaining the pattern

   ```bash
   # Find well-documented examples
   grep -r "pattern-keyword" --include="*.py" -B 5 | grep -E "^\s*#|^\s*\"\"\"" | wc -l
   ```

2. **Simplicity** - Simpler examples are better for learning

   ```bash
   # Find shorter files (likely simpler)
   grep -rl "pattern-keyword" --include="*.py" | xargs wc -l | sort -n | head -5
   ```

3. **Recency** - Recent code shows current best practices

   ```bash
   # Find recent examples
   grep -rl "pattern-keyword" --include="*.py" | xargs ls -lt | head -5
   ```

4. **Multiple variations** - Show different approaches if they exist
   ```bash
   # Compare different implementations
   grep -r "pattern-keyword" --include="*.py" -l | head -3
   ```

**STEP 4: Read Examples Fully**

Read 2-3 selected examples **completely** to understand the pattern:

```bash
# Example: Variable outputs in Galaxy
# After finding: tools/tool1.xml, tools/tool2.xml, tools/advanced.xml

Read: tools/tool1.xml  # Simple example
Read: tools/tool2.xml  # Standard example
Read: tools/advanced.xml  # Complex variation (if needed)
```

**STEP 5: Extract and Explain the Pattern**

After reading examples, explain:

1. **The core pattern** - How it works conceptually
2. **Required elements** - What's needed to implement it
3. **Common variations** - Different ways to use it
4. **Common pitfalls** - What to avoid
5. **Best practices** - Recommended approach

### When to Use Targeted Learning

**Use targeted learning when user:**

- Asks "how do I..." about specific feature
- Requests "show me examples of X"
- Wants to learn specific pattern/technique
- Has focused technical question
- References specific concept/API/feature

**Don't use for:**

- "Understand this codebase" (use broad exploration)
- "What does this project do?" (use documentation reading)
- "Debug this error" (use debugging mode, not learning mode)

---

### Key Principles for Targeted Learning

1. **Search first, read second**
   - Use grep to find relevant examples
   - Rank by quality/simplicity/recency
   - Then read selected examples fully

2. **Read 2-3 examples, not 20**
   - Simple example (minimal working code)
   - Standard example (common usage)
   - Complex example (advanced features) - optional

3. **Extract the pattern**
   - Don't just show code, explain the pattern
   - Highlight key elements and structure
   - Show variations and alternatives

4. **Provide context**
   - Where this pattern is used
   - When to use it vs alternatives
   - Common pitfalls and best practices

5. **Confirm understanding**
   - Ask if user needs specific variation
   - Offer to show related patterns
   - Check if explanation answered their question

---

## Broad Repository Exploration

When entering broad exploration mode, **first identify the repository context**, then apply the appropriate exploration strategy.

### STEP 1: Identify Repository Type

**Ask these questions or check indicators:**

```bash
# Check for multiple independent tools/packages
ls -d */ | wc -l  # Many directories at root level?
ls recipes/ tools/ packages/ 2>/dev/null  # Collection structure?

# Check for submission/contribution guidelines
ls -la | grep -i "contrib\|guideline\|submiss"
cat CONTRIBUTING.md README.md 2>/dev/null | grep -i "structure\|organization\|layout"

# Check for monolithic vs modular structure
find . -name "setup.py" -o -name "package.json" -o -name "Cargo.toml" | wc -l
# 1 = monolithic, many = multi-package

# Check for specific patterns
ls -la | grep -E "recipes/|tools/|workflows/|plugins/|examples/"
```

**Repository type indicators:**

1. **Tool Library / Recipe Collection** (bioconda, tool collections)
   - Multiple independent directories at same level
   - Each subdirectory is self-contained
   - Examples: `recipes/tool1/`, `recipes/tool2/`, `workflows/workflow-a/`
   - Indicator files: `recipes/`, `tools/`, `packages/`, multiple `meta.yaml` or `package.json`

2. **Monolithic Application** (single integrated codebase)
   - One main entry point
   - Hierarchical module structure
   - Shared dependencies and utilities
   - Examples: `src/`, `lib/`, single `setup.py`, `main.py`

3. **Framework / SDK** (extensible system)
   - Core framework + plugins/extensions
   - Base classes and interfaces
   - Examples: `core/`, `plugins/`, `extensions/`, `base/`

4. **Example / Template Repository**
   - Multiple example implementations
   - Each directory shows different pattern
   - Examples: `examples/`, `samples/`, `templates/`

---

### STEP 2: Apply Context-Specific Strategy

#### Strategy A: Tool Library / Recipe Collection

**Goal:** Learn the pattern from representative examples

**Approach:**

```bash
# 1. Find most recently modified (shows current best practices)
ls -lt recipes/ | head -10  # or tools/, workflows/, etc.

# 2. Find most common patterns
find recipes/ -name "meta.yaml" -o -name "*.xml" | head -1 | xargs dirname

# 3. Read submission guidelines first
cat CONTRIBUTING.md README.md | grep -A 20 -i "structure\|format\|template"

# 4. Read 2-3 representative examples
# Pick: 1 recent, 1 complex, 1 simple
ls -lt recipes/ | head -3
```

**Files to read (in order):**

1. `CONTRIBUTING.md` or submission guidelines -> Learn required structure
2. Recent tool/recipe -> Current best practices
3. Well-established tool/recipe -> Proven patterns
4. Template or example -> Base structure

---

#### Strategy B: Monolithic Application

**Goal:** Understand execution flow and architecture

**Approach:**

```bash
# 1. Find entry point
find . -name "main.py" -o -name "app.py" -o -name "run*.py" | grep -v test | head -5

# 2. Find most imported modules (core components)
grep -r "^import\|^from" --include="*.py" . | \
  sed 's/.*import //' | cut -d' ' -f1 | cut -d'.' -f1 | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# 3. Find orchestrators/managers
find . -name "*manager.py" -o -name "*orchestrator.py" -o -name "*controller.py"

# 4. Check recent changes (active development areas)
git log --name-only --pretty=format: --since="1 month ago" | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

**Files to read (in order):**

1. `README.md` -> Overview and architecture
2. Entry point (`main.py`, `run_all.py`) -> Execution flow
3. Core orchestrator/manager -> Main logic
4. Most-imported utility module -> Common patterns
5. One domain-specific module -> Implementation details

---

#### Strategy C: Framework / SDK

**Goal:** Understand core abstractions and extension points

**Approach:**

```bash
# 1. Find base classes and interfaces
grep -r "^class.*Base\|^class.*Interface\|^class.*Abstract" --include="*.py" | head -10

# 2. Find core module
ls -la | grep -E "core/|base/|framework/"

# 3. Find plugin/extension examples
ls -la | grep -E "plugins?/|extensions?/|examples?/"

# 4. Check documentation for architecture
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l -i "architecture\|design\|pattern" | head -5
```

**Files to read (in order):**

1. Architecture documentation -> Design philosophy
2. Base/core classes -> Fundamental abstractions
3. Simple plugin/extension -> How to extend
4. Complex plugin/extension -> Advanced patterns

---

#### Strategy D: Example / Template Repository

**Goal:** Learn different patterns and use cases

**Approach:**

```bash
# 1. List all examples
ls -d examples/*/ samples/*/ templates/*/

# 2. Read index/catalog if available
cat examples/README.md examples/INDEX.md

# 3. Pick representative examples
# - Simple/basic example
# - Medium complexity
# - Advanced/complete example
```

**Files to read (in order):**

1. `examples/README.md` -> Overview of examples
2. Basic example -> Minimal working pattern
3. Advanced example -> Full-featured pattern
4. Compare differences -> Learn progression

---

### STEP 3: Execution Strategy Template

**For ANY repository type, use this workflow:**

```bash
# PHASE 1: Context Discovery (always token-efficient)
ls -la  # Repository structure
cat README.md  # Overview
ls -la .github/ docs/ | head -20  # Find documentation
cat CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null | head -50  # Submission guidelines

# PHASE 2: Identify Type (ask user if unclear)
"I see this repository has [X structure]. Is this:
A) A tool library where each tool is independent?
B) A monolithic application with integrated components?
C) A framework with core + plugins?
D) A collection of examples/templates?

This helps me choose the best files to learn from."

# PHASE 3: Strategic Reading (based on type)
[Apply appropriate strategy A/B/C/D from above]
Read 2-5 key files fully
Grep for patterns across remaining files

# PHASE 4: Summarize and Confirm
"Based on [files read], I understand:
- Pattern/architecture: [summary]
- Key components: [list]
- Common patterns: [examples]

Is this the area you want to focus on, or should I explore [other aspect]?"
```

---

### File Selection Priorities (General Rules)

**Priority 1: Documentation**

```bash
README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/architecture.md
# These explain intent, not just implementation
```

**Priority 2: Entry Points**

```bash
# Monolithic: main.py, app.py, run.py, __main__.py
# Library: Most recent example in collection
```

**Priority 3: Core Components**

```bash
# Most imported modules
grep -r "import" | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# "Manager", "Controller", "Orchestrator", "Core", "Base"
find . -name "*manager*" -o -name "*core*" -o -name "*base*"
```

**Priority 4: Representative Examples**

```bash
# Recent files (current best practices)
ls -lt directory/ | head -5

# Medium complexity (not too simple, not too complex)
wc -l **/*.py | sort -n | awk 'NR > 10 && NR < 20'
```

**Priority 5: Active Development Areas**

```bash
# Git history (if available)
git log --name-only --since="1 month ago" --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

---

### Key Principle for Learning Mode

**Balance understanding with efficiency:**

- Read 2-5 **strategic** files fully (based on context)
- Use grep/head/tail for **pattern discovery** across many files
- **Ask user** which aspect to focus on after initial exploration
- **Summarize** findings before reading more

**Don't:**

- Read 20+ files sequentially without strategy
- Read files without understanding their role
- Ignore repository context and documentation
